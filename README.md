|<p align="left">Hello from Berlin! My name is Ji, and I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in AI, gaming, and visual effects. While you might find some of my coding projects on GitHub, it's important to note that it only represents a fraction of my work. I have a bunch of  Python AI projects, react Apps, games, and Houdini creations that are not showcased here. Outside of coding, I enjoy cycling, exploring the world of synthesizers, practicing kung fu, and I'm an avid enthusiast of Visual Studio Code. I'm excited to share my journey and learnings with you!</p| <img src="https://github.com/ji-soft/ji-soft/blob/main/result1709804787-ezgif.com-resize.gif?raw=true" width="350%" /> |
